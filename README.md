frontaccounting
===============

This is an unofficial Git Repo for frontaccounting and it's extensions / utilities.
Currently only the official v2.3.x branch is supported here.
My mods and pending commits to the core are in the <a href="https://github.com/apmuthu/frontaccounting/blob/master/FAMods>FAMods</a> folder and documented in the [FA 2.3 Support Wiki](https://github.com/apmuthu/frontaccounting/wiki).

The official <a href="http://frontaccounting.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/frontaccounting/frontaccounting/">FrontAccounting Source Tree</a> uses Mercurial on SourceForge 
and has been officially <a href="http://devel.frontaccounting.com/git/">mirrored on Git</a> from 2013-04-16 onwards.

Caveats:
========
<ul>
<li>This repo will be updated only when I have the time.</li>
<li>It is meant to enable easy localised forking on GitHub from any release.</li>
<li>It can be used to study differences for migration between versions where individual proficiency in using GIT is better than in using Mercurial.</li>
<li>Like any development code repo, code here should be used with care.</li>
<li>Do not be fooled that any snapshot is well tested stable release, while in many times it is not.</li>
<li>Using full random snapshots of FA repo is officially unwelcome.</li>
<li>FA Repo code is placed here for study, development and local deployment only especially where internet is not available.</li>
<li>FA versions are not released too often in order to provide a minimal acceptable level of stability, which is important especially in accounting software.</li>
<li>Any changes in the code that are not yet in the official repo is listed in the <a href="https://github.com/apmuthu/frontaccounting/blob/master/FAMods/CHANGELOG_apmuthu.txt">CHANGELOG_apmuthu.txt</a>.</li>
