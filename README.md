The old official <a href="http://frontaccounting.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/frontaccounting/frontaccounting/">FrontAccounting Source Tree</a> used Mercurial on SourceForge 
and was officially <a href="http://devel.frontaccounting.com/git/">mirrored on Git</a> till 2013-05-16.

Current Sole Repois on <a href="http://devel.frontaccounting.com/git/">Git</a>.

Caveats:
========
<ul>
<li>This repo will be updated only when I have the time.</li>
<li>It is meant to enable easy localised forking on GitHub from any release.</li>
<li>It can be used to study differences for migration between versions where individual proficiency in using GIT is better than in using Mercurial.</li>
<li>Like any development code repo, code here should be used with care.</li>
<li>Do not be fooled that any snapshot is well tested stable release, while in many times it is not.</li>
<li>Using full random snapshots of FA repo is officially unwelcome.</li>
<li>FA Repo code is placed here for study, development and local deployment only especially where internet is not available.</li>
<li>FA versions are not released too often in order to provide a minimal acceptable level of stability, which is important especially in accounting software.</li>
<li>The FA project has established an automatically updated <a href="http://devel.frontaccounting.com/git/">GIT mirror repo</a> that has all the incremental HG and older changes publicly available since 2013-04-16.</li>
</ul>
